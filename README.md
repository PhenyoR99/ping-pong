The objective is to score points by making the ball land on the opponent's side of the table without them returning it. Points are typically scored when the opponent fails to return the ball, hits it out of bounds, or misses the table entirely. The game is played to a predetermined number of points, usually 11 or 21, and players must win by at least two points.
